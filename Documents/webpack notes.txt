Build up webpack environment:
1. Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org
2. Download typescript using command: npm install -g typescript
3. Go to the project folder and type commands:
    tsc --init                     (Initialize typescript environment. A "tsconfig.json" file will be generated)
    npm init                       (Initialize Nodejs package manager to install the following packages. A "package.json" file will be generated)
    npm install webpack            (webpack compiler)
    npm install webpack-cli        (command line interface of webpack)
    npm install webpack-dev-server (a live server for webpack debugging)
    npm install ts-loader          (teaches webpack how to compile typescript into javascript)
    npm install typescript         (need a local copy of typescript compiler even if we have a global one)
A "node_modules" folder is generated, and all the dependencies are inside it.

4. Change the "module" property in tsconfig.json file to "ES2015"

5. Add a "webpack.config.js" file in the project folder.

const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
    devtool: 'eval-source-map',
    mode: 'none',
    entry: './src/index.ts',
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.ts$/,
                use: 'ts-loader',
                include: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')]
            }
        ]
    },
    resolve:{
        extensions: ['.ts', '.js']
    },
    output: {
        publicPath: 'public',
        filename: 'bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public')
    }
}

6. Add a folder named "public" for html, css and js files, and another folder "src" for typescript files.
7. Create index.html in "public" folder, and index.js in "src" folder, and write the starter "Hello world" code.
8. Add the following lines in the "scripts" property in the package.json:
    "build": "webpack",
    "serve": "webpack-dev-server",

9. type command: npm run build
10. Uncomment the "sourceMap" property in tsconfig.json.
11. run npm run serve
    ctrl+click the http url to run the server in browser
    ctrl+C in terminal to stop running
